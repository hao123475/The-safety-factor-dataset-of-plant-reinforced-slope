# The-safety-factor-dataset-of-plant-reinforced-slope
The safety factor dataset of plant-reinforced slopes was calculated by using the limit equilibrium method (Morgenstern-Price). The influencing characteristics include slope height, slope Angle, soil cohesion, soil internal friction Angle, Unit weight, pore water pressure coefficient, root additional cohesion and root reinforcement depth
